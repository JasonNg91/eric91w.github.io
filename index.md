I currently study at the College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University and was a visiting student at the Deparment of Geomatics, University of Calgary. 

I'm doing researches in satellite navigation and integrated navigation. My current project are 'Multi-frequency GNSS software-defined receiver' and its GNSS/INS integration navigation system.
